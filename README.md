# Dugout

Dugout is a sports-media application made especially for cricket enthusiasts built in Flutter. The application was built as a course project and also makes use of Machine Learning techniques in order to predict valuable information about ongoing matches. 

Initially, our plan was to include live scores along with real-time data and fetch live data through APIs but these APIs are paid and cost a significant amount. So we decided to develop the UI for most of 
the features that a sports-media app could offer and for now, loaded static data through JSON. 

The Machine learning models have been successfully implemented for features like Win Predicition, Team Score Prediction and Player Score Prediciton.

The application still has a huge scope of improvement by making the UI more pleasing, introducing several new features and most importantly be customized for currently ongoing cricket tournaments.
